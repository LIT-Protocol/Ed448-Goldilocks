VERY BIG WIP

## Field Choice

-  Curve448 is defined over the Solinas trinomial prime 2^448 - 2^224 -1. This prime is called the Goldilocks prime.
- We will denote the Goldilocks prime with the variable `q`.

## Curve parameters

- This curve satisifies the safe curves criteria.

d = -39081

## Cofactor 

Both curves have cofactor 4
